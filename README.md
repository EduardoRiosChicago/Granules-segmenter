# Granules-segmenter
Is this pixel inside a glycogen granule?
this model is a 2-class segmenter, which decides whether a pixel is within a glycogen granule or outside it.  It is complementary to Locations-segmenter. Together they yield granular content in all regions of a muscle cell.
Code for both segmenters ("Locations" and "Granules" was updated on May 21, 2024, with the versions published in Rios et al., J. Gen. Physiol. 2024.
